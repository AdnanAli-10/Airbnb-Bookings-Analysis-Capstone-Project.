### Problem statement:

Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present a more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. Today, Airbnb became one of a kind service that is used and recognized by the whole world. Data analysis on millions of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. These millions of listings generate a lot of data - data that can be analyzed and used for security, business decisions, understanding of customers' and providers' (hosts) behavior and performance on the platform, guiding marketing initiatives, implementation of innovative additional services and much more.

Our main aim here is to perform exploratory data analysis on this airbnb bookings data and fetch meaningful insights from it.

### Defining a hypothetical situation:

To not keep this EDA all about coding and some plain insights, I have defined a hypothetical situation to keep the reader connected and interested in the project.
Now, let me tell you about the hypothetical situation. Let us assume that my dad is a wealthy individual who is interested in investing in the real estate market of New York city. His friend has advised him to list out the property he buy's on Airbnb so that he has continuous cash flow from the property.

Now, my dad tell me to research about Airbnb and get to know facts that could help make his investment as profitable as it can get. Me being a data scientist I take the data approach and embark on this journey of getting insights through EDA and making my dad PROUD!!
